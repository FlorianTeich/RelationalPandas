# ü¶ëüêºüêç RelationalPandas - Enrich your DataFrames by Relations

## Abstract

Define relationships between dataframes in order to visually inspect your data more comfortable.

## Introduction

Ever worked on multiple DataFrames that are somehow semantically related (e.g. by referencing each other)?
Take these two DataFrames for instance:

| PersonID | Name  |
|----------|-------|
| 0        | Bob   |
| 1        | Alice |

| CarType       | OwnerID |
|---------------|---------|
| VW id3        | 1       |
| Toyota Aygo X | 0       |
| Audi a3       | 1       |

I wish there was a better way to inspect the data visually than to stare at these tables.
I want to be able to reorganize the entirety of data as a knowledge graph to reflect the inherent relationship between the involved objects.
Here is the same data but reorganized and visualized given the relation between the entities:

## ‚ú® Installation

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/FlorianTeich/RelationalPandas
cd RelationalPandas
pip install -e .
```

## üöÄ Quickstart

``` python
import RelationalPandas as rp

df1 = pd.DataFrame({"PersonID": [0, 1], "Name": ["Bob", "Alice"]})
df2 = pd.DataFrame({"CarType": ["VW id3", "Toyota Aygo X", "Audi a3"], "OwnerID": [1, 0, 1]})

collection = rp.new_collection()
collection.register_dataframes([df1, df2])
collection.register_name_columns(["Name", "CarType"])
collection.register_relations([[df1, df2, "PersonID", "OwnerID"]])
collection.visualize()
```
