Enrich your DataFrames by Relations
---------------------------------------------------

Abstract
-----------------

Define relationships between dataframes in order to visually inspect your data more comfortable.

Introduction
-----------------

Ever worked on multiple DataFrames that are somehow semantically related (e.g. by referencing each other)?
Take these two DataFrames for instance:

.. list-table:: Dataframe 1
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Person ID
     - Name
   * - 0
     - Bob
   * - 1
     - Alice

.. list-table:: DataFrame 2
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - CarType
     - OwnerID
   * - VW id3
     - 1
   * - Toyota Aygo X
     - 0
   * - Audi a3
     - 1

I wish there was a better way to inspect the data visually than to stare at these tables.
I want to be able to reorganize the entirety of data as a knowledge graph to reflect the inherent relationship between the involved objects.
Here is the same data but reorganized and visualized given the relation between the entities:

‚ú® Installation
-----------------

..  code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/FlorianTeich/RelationalPandas
   cd RelationalPandas
   pip install -e .

üöÄ Quickstart
-----------------

..  code-block:: python

   import pandas as pd
   import RelationalPandas as rp

   df1 = pd.DataFrame({"PersonID": [0, 1], "Name": ["Bob", "Alice"]})
   df2 = pd.DataFrame({
      "CarType": ["VW id3", "Toyota Aygo X", "Audi a3"],
      "OwnerID": [1, 0, 1]})

   collection = rp.Collection()
   collection.register_dataframes([df1, df2])
   collection.register_name_columns(["Name", "CarType"])
   collection.register_relations([[df1, df2, "PersonID", "OwnerID"]])
   collection.visualize()
